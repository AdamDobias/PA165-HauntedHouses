## Project assignment: Haunted Houses

There exist a few houses that are haunted by strange creatures. Each creature has its own abilities and it lives in exactly one house. A house has a name, an address (not an entity), a date when it became haunted, and a brief history. Each creature has a scary name, a date when it started to haunt (this is only one interval; the creature sleeps for the rest of the day), and a description with for example the creature's features and the reasons why it became a spook. Abilities have a name, a description, and other fields as well. More creatures can have the same ability.
